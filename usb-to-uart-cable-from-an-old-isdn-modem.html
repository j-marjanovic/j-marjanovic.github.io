</div><!-- /.post-info -->          <p>A short intermezzo from all FPGA-related stuff, this time we deal with an
8051-based USB device. This blog post describes how I converted an ISDN modem
(with a USB connection) to a USB-to-UART cable.</p>
<p>During my vacation at my parents' house, I wanted to access the UART on the
Ultra96 board to investigate the Linux boot procedure. Surprisingly, I did not
manage to find a Raspberry Pi or anything else which can talk UART, but I found
a box with old electronics. Among old phones, computer motherboards, GPUs, and
other relics of the past I found a PCB with a USB and an RJ45 connector. My
sixth sense for electronics made me think that this is a good starting point for
a USB-to-UART cable; the device already has a USB, and there will likely be a
UART port somewhere. </p>
<p><em>Note: no half-sane person would go this way to implement a simple
USB-to-UART bridge. If talking UART from your computer is your principal
objective, just buy a cable, or use a Raspberry Pi.</em></p>
<h1>Initial inspection</h1>
<h2>USB</h2>
<p>The first thing I did is plugging the device into a computer, mainly to verify
that it is still somehow alive. The following was printed out in the <code>dmesg</code>
output:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="m">[11816.274833] </span><span class="k">usb 1-4.1:</span> new full-speed USB device number 7 using xhci_hcd
<span class="m">[11818.795110] </span><span class="k">usb 1-4.1:</span> New USB device found, idVendor=071d, idProduct=1000, bcdDevice= 0.3c
<span class="m">[11818.795119] </span><span class="k">usb 1-4.1:</span> New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3
<span class="m">[11818.795122] </span><span class="k">usb 1-4.1:</span> Product: Eicon DIVA USB
<span class="m">[11818.795125] </span><span class="k">usb 1-4.1:</span> Manufacturer: Eicon Technology
<span class="m">[11818.795128] </span><span class="k">usb 1-4.1:</span> SerialNumber: 0000001000
</code></pre></div>


<p>We see that the USB works, and we also got the product name (<code>Eicon DIVA USB</code>).
A quick search on the internet revealed that this device is an ISDN modem, which
matches the observation, an RJ45 socket and the date code of June 1999.</p>
<p>There is even a web page dedicated to various ISDN cards, where the main
characteristics of this device are listed: <a href="https://www.isdncards.com/eicon-diva-usb">ISDN Cards Central: Eicon Diva
USB</a></p>
<h2>PCB overview</h2>
<p><img alt="Software in action" src="./images/2021_ez_usb/pcb_front_rear.jpg" style="width:50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>There are several easily-identifiable components on the PCB:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://media.digikey.com/pdf/Data%20Sheets/Cypress%20PDFs/AN2131SC,QC,AN2135SC,36SC.pdf">Cypress Semiconductor

  32kbit I2C EEPROM (presumably to store manufacturer ID and maybe the program
  for the EZ-USB)</li>
<li>some power-section related ICs</li>
</ul>
<h1>EZ-USB™</h1>
<p>The main microcontroller on this board (AN2135SC) was designed specifically to
simplify the development of USB-based devices. EZ-USB Technical Reference Manual
is from May 2000, while the USB 1.1 standard was released in August 1998. The
TRM goes to a great length to explain the advantages of the USB ("Plug and
Play") and also serves as an introduction of the protocol itself.</p>

<h1>Reverse-engineering the board</h1>
<p>Since there are no BGA components on this board, and the main microcontroller
has only 44 pins, one can easily use a multimeter to reverse engineer the
connections between the most important components.</p>
<p>I gathered the obtained knowledge in the schematics below:</p>
<p><img alt="Reverse-engineered schematics for EICON DIVA USB" src="./images/2021_ez_usb/eicon_diva_schematics_partial.png" style="width:70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h1>Modifications</h1>
<p>From the schematics it is clear that one can easily reach the UART port with
some small modifications to the board:</p>
<ul>
<li>remove U103 MOSFET</li>
<li>connect LED to PC6 (rotate R210 90deg to disconnect one pad, connect the
  flying pad on the R210 to the uC)</li>
<li>connect UART RX cable to PC0 (R208 pad)</li>
<li>connect UART TX cable to PC1 (R210 pad)</li>
<li>connect ground cable to GND</li>
</ul>
<h1>Firmware</h1>
<p>With hardware in place, it was time to write some firmware for the
microcontroller. I managed to find a project on GitHub, titled
<a href="https://github.com/hansiglaser/ezusb-firmware">ezusb-firmware</a>, which can serve
as a starting point for custom developments. It is licensed under GPLv2 or later
and uses <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/">sdcc</a> compiler.</p>
<h2>Programming the microcontroller</h2>
<p>After modifying the code to match the pinout on the (modified) board, and
compiling the code with <code>sdcc</code> a HEX file is produces. This gets then
easily downloaded to the board with the aforementioned <code>fxload</code> utility:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">$</span> sudo fxload -D /dev/bus/usb/001/008 -s /usr/share/usb/a3load.hex -I firmware.hex -t an21 -v
<span class="go">microcontroller type: an21</span>
<span class="go">1st stage:  load 2nd stage loader</span>
<span class="go">open RAM hexfile image /usr/share/usb/a3load.hex</span>
<span class="go">stop CPU</span>

<span class="go">&lt;...&gt;</span>
<span class="go">write on-chip, addr 0x036e len   12 (0x000c)</span>

<span class="go">write on-chip, addr 0x000b len    1 (0x0001)</span>
<span class="go">&lt;...&gt;</span>
<span class="go">write on-chip, addr 0x0862 len   32 (0x0020)</span>
<span class="go">... WROTE: 2378 bytes, 33 segments, avg 72</span>
<span class="go">reset CPU</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>With the proverbial LED blinking, I was able to confirm that this method of
programming the microcontroller works and that the firmware project works
correctly.</p>
<p>I have continued the development by adding a UART-related code and later
implemented a method to retrieve the UART buffer over the USB and to transmit
the data over the UART from the USB. The code can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/j-marjanovic/ezusb-uart/tree/master/firmware">ezusb-uart/firmware</a>.</p>
<h1>Software</h1>
<p>As the last step, I hacked together an example from the
<a href="https://libusb.info/">libusb</a> library and some code to manage the receive and
transmit buffers. Ideally the terminal management (using the <code>termios</code> API)
would be more elaborated, ideally one would also use a dedicated library for
such a task. But since the goal was just to capture some data from the Ultra96,
the current implementation is sufficient.</p>
<p>The code is available in <a href="https://github.com/j-marjanovic/ezusb-uart/tree/master/software">ezusb-uart/software</a>.</p>
<p>Shown in the screenshot below is the output of <code>ezuart</code> utility when connected
to the Ultra96 board:</p>
<p><img alt="Software in action" src="./images/2021_ez_usb/software_example.png" style="width:60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Without too much effort, I was able to convert this ISDN modem to a USB-to-UART
cable. Several factors contributed to this:</p>
<ul>
<li>the microcontroller on this board was specifically designed to facilitate
  the development of USB devices</li>
<li>the firmware for this device is downloaded over the USB, allowing easy 
  modifications and development of custom firmware</li>
<li>the PCB was relatively simple (no BGAs)</li>
<li>a fantastic firmware project by Martin Schmoelzer and Johann Glaser as a
  skeleton for my development</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a couple of limitations, the most jarring one is that this
microcontroller does not support 115200 baud operation, making it not really
suitable as a general-purpose UART cable. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I would classify this project as a success - I have managed to
convert an old piece of junk to a device, which can provide some insight into
the boot procedure of the Zynq on the Ultra96 board.</p>
