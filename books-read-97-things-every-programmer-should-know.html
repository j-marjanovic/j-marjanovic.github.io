<p>Category: <a href="./tag/software-engineering.html">Software Engineering</a>, </p>
</div><!-- /.post-info -->          <p>I have seen this book referenced on several occasions when the software
engineering was discussed, but I never had the time to read from first page to
the last. I bought the dead-tree version, which gives you a better motivation
to read the whole book. Here are my comments and thoughts about each
contribution in this book.</p>
<p style="width:70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="97 Things Every Programmer Should Know" src="./images/97_thing_every_programmer_should_know.jpg"></p>
<h2>(1) Act with Prudence by Seb Rose</h2>
<p>Technical debt is (similarly to a cash debt) a good way to kickstart the
development, but I agree with the author that is should be kept under control
and paid back as soon as possible. I much enjoy when a sub-optimal solution
gets fixed and the worries about possible problems with it vanish away.</p>
<h2>(2) Apply Functional Programming Principles by Edward Garson</h2>
<p>Yes, I am already excited about this book. The functional programming
principles (even in OO code) greatly improve testability of smaller components.
It also gives a programmer a different insight on how algorithms work, which
its a little more detached from how a classical computer works. Programming in
C feels like explaining complicated science to a 7 year old ("lets have a
number i, which is is set to 0. each time we will check if this number is less
than some other number n..."), while programming in Haskell feels like a
discussion with a philosopher ("there is this function fact for which the
value for 1 is 1. - oh, i see. - and for every other positive number, the
value is the argument itself multiplied by the value of function for an
argument minus one. - well, this is everything i needed to know about this
function, i think i know how to calculate it."</p>
<h2>(3) Ask, "What Would the User Do?" (You Are Not the User) by Giles Colborne</h2>
<p>This contribution is quite similar to Joel Spolsky
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000064.html">comment</a> on
how to test the use interface: "One good way to evaluate the usability of a
program or dialog you've never seen before is to act a little stupid".  The
important reminder to take away from this is to try being conservative with
the user interface, to minimize the learning how to use your program or
application.</p>
<h2>(4) Automate Your Coding Standard by Filip van Laenen</h2>
<p>Nicely formatted code demonstrates that the person who wrote it has put in a
little effort to make it nicer and that the same person is somebody who like
to keep things organized. On the contrary, when you see a messy code with
sections of the code commented out, you know that there is almost surely
something wrong with its behavior as well. Clearly defined language-prescribed
formating standard (such as PEP8) and the tools to support it (such as pep8
tool and pylint) are much welcomed. Meanwhile, the <a href="htt
ps://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/5eb0b587af06dc5d1d9cda0dd8c6b399
bdc1e230/CppCoreGuidelines.md">C++ coding guidelines</a> currently looks more like a brainstorming
session (why is there std::endl if you are not supposed to use it?)</p>
<h2>(5) Beauty Is in Simplicity by Jørn Ølmheim</h2>
<p>Simple solution are often the ones who work better, not only in software but
also in other fields, such as rock music. Trying to write the most legendary
rock riff of all time? You only need 4 notes (Yngwie does not agree with this:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHZ48AE3TOI">More is more</a> ). As an example
lets look at one  of the biggest code bases ever made: Linux kernel. The style
itself (tabs are 8 spaces, line is 80 characters) prevent you from writing too
complicated solution. The style guide for Linux kernel is a little extreme,
but since the kernel should be as lean as possible it produces indisputably
good results.</p>
<h2>(6) Before You Refactor by Rajith Attapattu</h2>
<p>This contribution is again very similar to one of Joel Spolsky's <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">blog
posts</a>. Since
reading code is harder than writing it everybody assumes that a complete
rewrite will create better code. All the ugly patches in the code are actual
bugfixes and the software (although with ugly code) works.</p>
<h2>(7) Beware the Share by Udi Dahan</h2>
<p>Using already written libraries is a nice practice, and this contribution
talks about creating unwanted dependencies in the code base. The discussion
here regards the internally developed libraries. The case described in this
contribution can be also analyzed in terms of the time spent maintaining
reusable code, something which is described in The Mythical Man-Month. Use of
public (external) stable libraries should be encouraged, although I would in
the controversial case of leftPad function prefer to have the leftPad function
embedded directly in code.</p>
<h2>(8) The Boy Scout Rule by Robert C. Martin</h2>
<p>This is one of the most famous contribution in this book, I don't think there
is much to add to it. It is always nice when you look back at the clean
campground (I sometimes like to admire the cleanup in side-by-side diff).</p>
<h2>(9) Check Your Code First Before Looking to Blame Others by Allan Kelly</h2>
<p>I would also like to add that a really good understanding of the language
(read the standard) and the compiler (read  the manual) can help you resolve
the problem without blaming the compiler. Personally I know about some miner
differences between Verilog compilers from Xilinx and Altera, which could let
someone think that the compiler is buggy.</p>
<h2>(10) Choose Your Tools with Care by Giovanni Asproni</h2>
<p>The author of this contribution mentions that he likes to isolate external
tools from his own business logic. I see this approach sometimes in open
source FPGA development when a wrapper around some commonly used IP cores is
build (e.g. wrapper around block RAM for both Altera and Xilinx which gets
chosen based on a parameter or a macro).</p>
<h2>(11) Code in the Language of the Domain by Dan North</h2>
<p>This contribution could be summarized as a call to use sensible
variable/functions/object/methods names. This could be as well extended to
writing informative comments, and not have comments like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="err">if (maxLim &lt; 0) // checks if max limit is negative</span>
</code></pre></div>


<h2>(12) Code Is Design by Ryan Brush</h2>
<p>The abstract process of making virtual artifacts (software) from nothing
cannot be compared with construction process. The possibility to experiment
with the real product gives direct feedback, which can be easily incorporated
into design process. I often see everyday physical objects which weren't
optimized to perfection, probably because of high iteration cost. The location
of power button on my HTC Desire is one of this design flaws, it cannot be
reached without changing the grip on the phone.</p>
<h2>(13) Code Layout Matters by Steve Freeman</h2>
<p>Indentation of the code is important, it provides the overview of the
complexity on the first glance. I look forward to GCC6 new warning on wrongly
indented C/C++ code.</p>
<h2>(14) Code Reviews by Mattias Karlsson</h2>
<p>Code reviews are important because they introduce all-seeing-eye in the code
writing process, and this makes programmers care more about code quality. One
cannot just make a ugly patch and hide in somewhere in the code base. The
ultimate code review is the release of the code to the public or to the
clients. In this case one can be sure that the company will be judged by the
quality of the released code. The same is true for the examples which
demonstrates the use of someone own tools.</p>
