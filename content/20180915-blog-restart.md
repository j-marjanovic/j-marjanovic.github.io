Title: Blog restart

This blog was left dormant for quite some time now. From the last blog post
in February 2017 a lot has happened. I have moved to Hamburg, Germany, to
start a new position as FPGA Developer at MicroTCA Technology Lab at
[DESY](https://www.desy.de/).

This is me in European XFEL tunnel:

There are a couple of topics which I would like to explore as a hobby, and
having a blog is a nice way to organize your thoughts and outputs. Writing a
blog post at the end of the project requires someone to gather his thoughts
and to write down the conclusion.

That is all for now, expect more interesting blog posts (probably focusing on
FPGA, mid-level languages as Chisel and high-level synthesis) in the future.
