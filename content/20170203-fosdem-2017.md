I am writing this post from Brussels where I am attending [FOSDEM 2017](https://fosdem.org/2017/)
conference.

There are a lot of interesting talks, and sometimes it is quite hard to decide
on which one to go. Luckily there the talks are recorded and one can later
check also the missed ones.

Here is my list of the talks I plan to attend:
