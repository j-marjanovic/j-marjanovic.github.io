It is actually along story before I got to write this blog post and although it
is not really important how I got here, I would like to share a bit of context.
I have started writing an implementation of MD5 hash function in Chisel, a
Scala-based Hardware Description Language. For quite some time I am getting
tired of SystemVerilog's "always_ff @(posedge clk) begin if reset q <= 0 ..."
and while the Vivado HLS gives great results I still wanted to see what is there
in the middle. I also dream of HLS language based on a functional programing
language, such as Haskell or Scala.

The MD5 function requires some padding of the input message, and I wanted to see
if I can process entire 512-bit chunk in a single clock cycle. I wrote a Python
script to generate some really huge priority encoder. Because of long
combinatorial chains required to implement such encoders, there could be some
problems meeting timing constraints.


Quartus 14.0
============

I had Quartus 14.0

The timin closure in Quartus 14.0 fails with clock frequency at 100 MHz. The
reported fmax is 70 and 75 MHz for slow, 85 degC and 0degC models, respectively.

If we observe placement, we can see that logic is placed in a circular shape at
the center of the FPGA fabric. This would indicate that the placer tried to put
logic as close as possible together. The priority encoder uses 1336 (21%) of
LUTs and 2176 (35%) of registers, which is somehow understandable figure, since
we are writing and reading data over a single pin. We need one 512-bit register
to store input and one 512-bit register to store output of encoder.

Quartus 15.1
============

Quartus 15.1 fails with even greater margin (reported fmax 68 and 73).
