Hi and welcome to my blog.

This is a "hello world" style post, I am curently testing pelican static blog generator.
Since I don't know how much time I will have to manage this blog I prefer that everything 
is static. If I some day stop writing this blog, at least there won't be any security threats
due to out-of-date web page.

This blog will be about one of my biggest passions, electronics and technology in general.
Since I was a kid I was curious about electronic devices and to this day I always enjoy
taking thing appart (and sometimes also together, that is what I am being paid for). 

This is all for now, let's see if it "compiles"...
