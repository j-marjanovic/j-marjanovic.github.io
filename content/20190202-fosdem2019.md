# Quantum Computing

## Delivering Practical Quantum Computing on the D-Wave System

### Intro

* marketing slide for D-Wave Leap
* practical = Adiabatic Quantum computer
* Riggeti uses gate model instead
* physical impl: 3 m high box + 3 normal racks
* QPU (Quantum Processor Unit): 16x16 grid

### theory

* language
    * qubit
    * coupler (either both in same direction or opposite)
    * weights (? initial state)
    * strength (for couplers)
    * objective (function which gets minimized)
* BQM (?)
* 5 us annealing
* problems: noise
* noise can bring you in more than one solution (might be useful for some problems)

### Markets

* portfolio
* internet ad
* high-energy physics
* image recognition

### Q & A

* clock speed -> no clock speed
* total computation time -> 5 us to 1 s
* Pegasus: proposed arch for a new machine
* new Hamiltonioan in Pegasus
* error corrections: from 2048 bits, no error corrections because of what
  they calculate
* classical solutions vs quantum solutions: wall-clock time is the benchmark
* hello world: 
* D-Wave: not a threat for a normal crypto (factoring a number is not a good problem)


## D-Wave's Software Development Kit

* tools and utilities for QC development

### motivation

* solution space is "smooth": good solutions are "grouped together"
* step 1: problem as polynomial

### equation

* b-terms: linear bias
* a-terms: quadratic bias

Quantum Machine Instr: biases in certain range: because of physical limitaiton?
* Chimera graph and Pegasus graph

### Ocean software

* Python front-end, C++ for high performance

* mapping methods
* samplers
* compute resources


#### dimod

* API for samplers
* BQM

#### cloud client

#### minorminer

#### dwavebinaryscp

constraint satisfaction

#### dwave-networkx

graph theory problem,
same API as networkx

### Steps

1. translate to binary
2. define BQM function
3. BQM to matrix form
4. BQM through sampler
5. post-processing and interpretation

### Conclusion

`pip install dwave-ocean-sdk`


### Q & A

* resolution: 0.01 resolution
* Fujitsu and Hitachi: another providers
* 8 couplers per qbit


## D-Wave Hybrid Framework

* decomposition -> split the problem to fit into BQM

github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-hybrid

* solver/sampler framework
* uses both quantum and classical resources
* dataflow paradigm

## What is IBMQ

### quantum algorithms

* current algorithms --> quantum algorithms
* supra-polynomial speed-up
* Schor's algorithm: polynomial time for factoring of the numbers
* simulating quantum mechanics (Hamiltonian equations); for chemistry
* factoring 1024-bit number: hours with QC
* how to program a QC: mapping interference pattern on qbits

  * entanglement -> consistent quantum system -> colapse
  * every quantum program: circuit (no feedback!)
  * result is non deterministic (robust algorithms provide good results)

* quantum volume (metric used at IBM)
* coherence time: 100s of us

* technology is quantum ready

### quantum technologies

* superconductive Josephson junction
* entaglion (only hypothetical?)
* QASM (quantum assembly language)
* 5 GHz, 240 mK, low noise
* all QC look similar: only way to do it
* current state: oscilloscopes, signal generators, ...
* pizza box for controlling the QC in the future

### quantum advantage

* IBM provides a lot of stuff on their GitHub
* Jupyter notebooks, vscode plugin
* Quiskit Acua: example problem: bonding energy for a molecule 
* Quiskit Aer: ...
* publicly available QC
* gate error and readout error are publicly available (~1e-3 for the example)
* IBM has several QC architectures (Tokyo, Melburne)

### Q & A

* noise problems for QC, do qbits produce noise -> engineering will find a solution
* quantum volue of Tokyo -> "the best, it is not just the number of qbits"
* Quiskit Aqua: chemistry API


# CAD and Open Hardware

## gnucap

### intro

- mixed-signal simulator
- prototype for Verilog-AMS (~10 years ago)
- analog circuits and digital circuits simulators are different (transient vs event-based)

### analog circuit simulation

- node equations --> matrix form
- often: differential equations, Newton iteration

### digital circuit simulation

- event based, with evaluation queue
- can be used

### Gnucap

- Gnucap decompose the circuit matrix into L and U
- Gnucap keeps track of the changes to the matrix, schedules an update to
  the circuit matrix 
- bypass = not computing something
- Gnucap uses all the tricks to calculate inverse of the matrix (pivoting)

### architecture of Gnucap

- the concept (matrix solving + event-based updates) is tighly integrated
  in the codebase
- plugin infrasctructure: modeling languages (VHDL, Verilog-AMS, SystemC considered)
- shared library for basic s

- compoenents are plugins (dlopen)

  - components
  - commands
  - algorithms 

### plugins

- Turing complete
- examples of plugins
  - import module (python)
  - insmod module (linux)

- `gnucap-python`, e.g. Jupyter, user can access internal data, use Scipy, ...
- Verilog-A in QUCS/gnucsator

### license for models

- Gnucap supports models from other sources

- two types:

- distributed as source code: --> just log it into the Gnucap (no issues)

- distributed as binary: --> wrapper + blob

### summary

- mixed-mode is faster
- more front-end work needed

## ngspice

- talk is not about the details, but about the framework, user interface and future

### intro

- input: standard SPICE text inpu
- output: transient simulator 
- successor of spice3f5 from Berkley

- three flavors:

  - standard executable: CLI, file and graphics output, control language
  - shared library for tcl/tk (not used so much)
  - C shared library (so/dll): input and output via callbacks

### scripting language

- its own library (developer don't like python)
- 94 commands, math functions, loops, ...

### device models

- hard-coded models (BJS, MOS, JFET, xFET, trans lines, Verilog A interface via adms)
- B source with build-in function
- XSPICE shared library (written in C, both analog and digital)

### application areas

- PCB design
  - mix of ICs and discrete components
  - requires a comfortable user interface (offered by 3rd parties - e.g. KiCAD)
  - PSPICE and LTSPICE model requirements

- IC design

## Open source virtual prototyping for faster hardware and software co-design

- virtual prototyping 

### current development

1. idea
2. SW and HW developed in parallel
3. integration

### virtual prototype

1. idea
2. virtual prototype --> SW can be developed in parallel

virtual prototyping: SW environment simulating the HW

### example

- model entire SoC (RPi: quad core, peripheral)

- issues:
  - models (of the IP) are hard to find
  - too much components --> needs to be done: shared effort

### ?

"interoperability is the key" --> take advantage of the community

- toolchain: marketplace for components, GUI, ...

### Q & A

- interface with SystemC and TLM: support for TLM is there
- modules: how to verify the model: ?

## Lesson learned from Retro-uC and search for ideal HDL for open source silicon

### intro

- idea: open source microcontroller (Z80, MOS 65 and 68000, 3 uC in one chip)
- + a development board
- "VHDL and Verilog are not the right tools for the job"

### RTL faults

- clock is logic signal
- if --> mux or flip-flop
- synth vs non-synth
- Verilog: block and non-blocking
- FPGA vs ASIC
- RTFLRM

### improvements

- signed
- process(all)
- generate
- ...

"putting a lipstick on a pig"

### new developments

- TL-Verilog
- SystemC/TLM
- "good tools are proprierty" (Vivado HLS, Catapult)
- Panda Bamboo
- GAUT (gaut.fr)

- MyHDL
- Chisel/SpinalHDL --> "going in the right direction" --> first need to learn Scala
- Migen/MiSoc/nmigen --> prefered by the speaker


# Python

## CPython Memory Management

### motivation

- what user needs to know
- learn how to control (gc, sys.getrefcount)
- memory leaks 

### allocation of memory

- CPython has PyObject for everything
- size: obj size < 512 bytes --> small, ele big
- big objects: system allocator
- small object: 3 levels, pools and arena

- 8-byte alignment --> size idx: size / 8 - 1

#### pools

- 4k size, objects of same size
- blocks 

#### arenas

- encapsulate pools
- containts 64 pools

#### object specificts

- string interning (simple string)
- small integers (-5 to 256)

### garbage collection

- reference counting
  - easy to find unused obj
  - no marking
  - memory overhead
  - no cyclical references

### tools in python

- two modules: gc and tracemalloc
- plus: sys._debugmallocstats()
