</div><!-- /.post-info -->          <p>The reverse engineering of the FPGA accelerator card from eBay is progressing
well and documenting the DDR3 interface was a huge step forward. However, there
is still one important part of the board which is not fully uncovered, the PCI
Express® interface.</p>
<h1>Hardware</h1>
<h2>Pikes Peak</h2>
<p>Pikes Peak is a Stratix® V-based FPGA accelerator conforming to <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/microsoft-ocs-v2-tray-mezzanine">Open CloudServer
OCS Tray Mezzanine
Specification</a>.
It connects to the motherboard with a 160-pin connector which provides power,
management, and a 16-lane-wide PCIe interface. With the resistors on the
<code>PCIE_CFG_ID</code>, Pikes Peak indicates 2 x8 bifurcation.</p>
<p>I have explored the various details of this board in previous posts on my blog.
Important for today's discussion is <a href="stratix-v-accelerator-card-from-ebay-part-2.html">the part
2</a>, where using a <a href="https://github.com/j-marjanovic/ocs-tray-mezzanine-adapter">custom HW
adapter</a> I was able
to establish the connection between the PC and the FPGA using the factory image
on the board (stored in on-board Flash).</p>
<p>The part number of the device (<code>5SGSD5</code>) indicates that it contains <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/hb/stratix-v/stx5_51001.pdf">one
PCIe hard IP block</a>.</p>
<p>At that time I have assumed that one link of 8 PCIe lanes is connected to
the PCIe hard IP block and that another x8 link is connected to 8 transceivers
on the other side of the device, maybe with the PCIe IP implemented in logic.
Later we will explore why this assumption is not correct.</p>
<h2>Storey Peak</h2>
<p>Storey Peak contains (roughly) the same components as Pikes Peak but in a
"normal" PCIe card form factor. For me, as a hobbyist who is not very keen on
designing custom HW and prefers to stay in the FPGA domain, this form factor is
much more convenient.</p>
<p>I have presented the main components of this board in a series of tweets a
couple of weeks ago:</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><a href="https://twitter.com/janmarjanovic/status/1383876145821589505">Tweet of janmarjanovic/1383876145821589505</a></blockquote></p>
<p>An attentive reader will note the difference between the PCIe devices IDs on
Storey Peak and Pikes Peak: Store Peak reports <code>0xb101</code> while Pikes Peak reports
<code>0xb100</code>.</p>
<h1>First test</h1>
<p>I have
<a href="https://github.com/j-marjanovic/otma-fpga-bringup/commit/da95ff009cd1d9d0664b099894da73b6e59f4eae">instantiated</a>
the <em>Avalon-MM Stratix V Hard IP for PCI Express</em> and connected it to a couple
of peripherals (GPIO, System ID) to provide a minimal example for access
from the computer. I have also connected the Hard IP status interface to the
Nios II processor, which allows me to query the status of the PCIe link over the
JTAG. There is only 1 location where the PCIe lanes can be connected in a
normal <code>5SGSD5</code> (annotated in light pink in the image below), so I connected the
PCIe lanes there.</p>
<p><img alt="PCIe pin locations" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/pcie_pins.png" style="width:60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h2>First test with Pikes Peak</h2>
<p>Once everything was set up I have connected the Pikes Peak board through the x1
extender to one of the slots in my DELL PowerEdge R720.</p>
<p><img alt="Pikes Peak in a server" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/pp_in_server.jpg" style="width:60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>The "OTMA adapter" does not properly connect the reset pin to the Pikes Peak
connector, and I had to manually issue a reset command after power-up. Below
is the output from the CLI running on the Nios II processor in FPGA:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>init done

pp_sp_example &gt; pcie status
pcie:
  id = 2c1e57a7
  version = 10000
  status.cur speed   = 0
  status.LTTSM state = 0
  status.lane act    = 0
  status.DL up       = 0

pp_sp_example &gt; clks
Clock counter: ident = 0xc10cc272, version = 0x10000
Clock frequency [0] =  124.999 MHz
Clock frequency [1] =  644.531 MHz
Clock frequency [2] =   99.998 MHz
Clock frequency [3] =   99.998 MHz
Clock frequency [4] =    0.000 MHz
Clock frequency [5] =    0.000 MHz
Clock frequency [6] =    0.000 MHz
Clock frequency [7] =    0.000 MHz

pp_sp_example &gt; pcie reset
pcie: asserting reset...
pcie: deasserted reset...
pcie: reset deasserted

pp_sp_example &gt; pcie status
pcie:
  id = 2c1e57a7
  version = 10000
  status.cur speed   = 2
  status.LTTSM state = f
  status.lane act    = 1
  status.DL up       = 0
</code></pre></div>

<p>We see that clocks 2 and 3 are both 100 MHz, which indicates that the PCIe clock
distribution works correctly, and after the reset the link reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>current speed: 5 GT/s</strong> - maximum supported by the IP in this configuration</li>
<li><strong>LTSSM state: L0</strong> - this is the state in which the state machine should be</li>
<li><strong>lane active: 1</strong> - as expected, the USB cable contains only one high-speed differential lane</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all looks very promising; once the PC boots I am also able to get the
same information from the <code>lspci</code> utility:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo lspci -s 03:00 -vv

<p>And finally, I can use <code>pcimem</code> to read and write to the registers in the FPGA,
e.g. read system ID and timestamp and write to a GPIO pin:</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The proverbial "blinky" is actually blinking and so far everything seems to be
working correctly.</p>
<h2>First test with Storey Peak</h2>
<p>Encouraged by the success with the Pikes Peak board and the adapter PCB, I have
installed the Storey Peak board instead. Compared to the Pikes Peak board and
the cable salad there, this one fits much nicer - both from purely esthetic as
well as thermal point-of-view.</p>
<p><img alt="Storey Peak in a server" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/sp_in_server.jpg" style="width:60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>And here I encountered an unpleasant surprise. Although the clocks are there,
the PCIe link can never reach the <em>L0</em> state, i.e. the link never finishes
training.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>pp_sp_example &gt; pcie status
pcie:
  id = 2c1e57a7
  version = 10000
  status.cur speed   = 1
  status.LTTSM state = 1a
  status.lane act    = 8
  status.DL up       = 0
</code></pre></div>

<p>Intel® provides good <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/FPGA-Wiki/FTA-PCI-express/ta-p/735993">troubleshooting resources for the PCIe
link</a>, and
I have decided to have a look at the PIPE interface to see the data exchange
between the FPGA and the CPU.</p>
<p><img alt="TS1 ordered sets" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/ts1.png" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>We can decode the data received by the first two transceivers and obtain
the information from the <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/pci-express-system/0321156307/0321156307_ch14lev1sec5.html">TS1 ordered sets</a>:</p>

</table>
<p>We see that the first transceiver receives lane number 8 and the second
transceiver receives lane number 9. At this point one can look again at the
board, and realize that the upper 8 lanes are connected to the PCIe Hard IP in
the FPGA.</p>
<p><img alt="Card with annotated FPGA" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/annotated.jpg" style="width:70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>This explains why we see lane 8 on the first transceiver, and also explains
why the link does not get established.</p>
<h2>Storey Peak in a computer which supports bifurcation</h2>
<p>Just for a test, I have plugged the Storey Peak card in a computer that
supports 2 x8 bifurcation on a x16 slot.</p>
<p><img alt="Bifurcation configuration" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/server_bifurcation.png" style="width:50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>We can see that in this configuration there are two PCIe endpoints presented:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ lspci
&lt;...&gt;
86:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Microsoft Corporation Device b100 (rev 01)
87:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Microsoft Corporation Device b101 (rev 01)
&lt;...&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>And each of them supports a x8 link. It is theoretically possible that one of
the endpoints is implemented in FPGA logic, but we will later see that this
is not the case.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ sudo lspci -s 86:00 -vv
86:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Microsoft Corporation Device b100 (rev 01)

&lt;...&gt;
        LnkSta:    Speed 8GT/s, Width x8, TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-
&lt;...&gt;

$ sudo lspci -s 87:00 -vv
87:00.0 Unassigned class [ff00]: Microsoft Corporation Device b101 (rev 01)
&lt;...&gt;
        LnkCap:    Port #1, Speed 8GT/s, Width x8, ASPM not supported, Exit Latency L0s &lt;4us, L1 &lt;1us
&lt;...&gt;
        LnkSta:    Speed 8GT/s, Width x8, TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt-
&lt;...&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Unfortunately the DELL R720 which I use in my homelab does not support PCIe
bifurcation.</p>
<h1>Investigation</h1>
<p>With some confusion regarding the assignment of PCIe lanes and the number of
hard IP blocks in this device, it is time to carefully check the presentation on
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/822126/contributions/3500184/attachments/1906428/3148591/Catapult_FastML_Fermilab_2019.pdf">Heterogeneous Computing @
Microsoft</a></p>
<p>Shown on slide 14 is the screenshot from Quartus® Chip Planner. Comparing this
screenshot with the Chip Planner view for a "normal" device, we can note that
in the presentation there is an additional PCIe block, which is not present
in a normal device.</p>
<p><img alt="Comparison between the two devices" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/msft_presentation.png" style="width:80%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h2>Web search</h2>
<p>There were a couple of speculation on <a href="https://twitter.com/rombik_su/status/1257741366144180226">Twitter by
@rombik_su</a> and
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FPGA/comments/7g0f80/altera_part_lookup/">reddit</a> on
what this part might be, and we can see that the last part of the code (reserved
for <em>Special order devices</em>) contains <strong>AC</strong>.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><a href="https://twitter.com/rombik_su/status/1257741366144180226">Tweet of rombik_su/1257741366144180226</a></blockquote></p>
<p>Searching for the full code (<strong>5SGSKF40I3LNAC</strong>) also finds a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/programmable/us/en/pdfs/literature/pcn/pdn2007.pdf">PDN from
Intel</a>
with a comment that the device is available "Upon Request, Please Contact Sales".</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Programmable-Devices/FA-request-of-3-PCS-FBGA-AJ000400T01-ALTERA-Mfr-P-N/td-p/1204542">a
thread</a>
on the Intel forum by somebody from Quanta who has a problem with a post-production
check on this device.</p>
<h2>Bitstream analysis</h2>
<p>At this point it is pretty clear that this device is a custom part with 2 PCIe
Hard IPs. I was curious if I am able to find the evince of the second IP
in the bitstream.</p>
<p>I have used the same approach as for the DDR3 controller: by changing one
variable at the time I was able to isolate the address in the JIC file which
corresponds to the individual PCIe IP parameter. By repeating this procedure I
was able to extract addresses for several parameters, especially interesting are
the ones that can be observed from the outside, such as vendor ID, device ID,
BAR type and size, ...</p>
<p>After I have managed to find the location of several parameters, I have
extracted the values from the original JIC. As expected, one can easily
see Microsoft® vendor ID (<code>0x1414</code>) and the device ID (<code>0xb100</code>):</p>
<p><img alt="Parameters extracted from the bitstream" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/bitstream_extract.png" style="width:60%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>I have then taken the bits which correspond to the PCIe block on the left side
and performed a weighted autocorrelation on the bitstream. The procedure
and the result can be found in a Jupyter <a href="https://github.com/j-marjanovic/otma-pin-re/blob/master/scripts/pcie_analysis/02_autocorrelation.ipynb">notebook</a>.</p>
<p>One can see that there is a strong peak very close to the original
configuration: the second configuration differs by just 1 bit. This is exactly
what one can expect since we know that the two endpoints have different device
IDs (<code>0xb100</code> and <code>0xb101</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="Auto-correlation of the original IP configuration" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/auto_corr.png" style="width:70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<p>With this we can confirm that there is a configuration for the second Hard IP
stored in the factory image in the on-board Flash.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>It is now clear that this board contains a custom part with two PCIe hard IP
blocks. Unfortunately, the block which is available in a normal
device is connected to the high lanes (lanes 8-15), and this requires at minimum
some support from the motherboard to be useful.</p>
<p>There are several possibilities on how to proceed here:</p>
<h2>Playing stupid method</h2>
<p>I tried playing stupid and just instantiated two hard IPs in my design.
Quartus was (as expected), not so easily fooled:</p>
<p><img alt="Error message when two hard IPs are instantiated with a normal part" src="./images/2021_fpga_card_part_7/2_ips.png" style="width:70%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></p>
<h2>Riser cable</h2>
<p>One could take a x16 riser cable and resolder the wires to swap the two x8
connections on the connector. This will only provide 8 lanes, as the second
hard IP cannot be used (yet).</p>
<h2>Upgrading my homelab server</h2>
<p>Is somebody interested in buying a DELL PowerEdge R720? :)</p>
<h2>Soft PCIe IP</h2>
<p>One could think about developing a soft IP and connect it directly to the
transceivers. The development effort here would be enormous since Physical,
Data, and Transaction Layers need to be handled in the logic. On the other hand,
this could also be a great learning experience to get familiar with the lower
layers of protocol, which are usually handled by a dedicated PCIe block.
Additionally, one would have to use few advanced features of the transceiver
itself (rate change, 8b/10b and 128b/130b decoder, receiver detection, lane
bonding, ...).</p>
<h2>Manipulating the bitstream</h2>
<p>Since we have the configuration stored in the factory bitstream, one could
consider "pasting" this configuration on top of a normal bitstream. This
method does not seem user-friendly, and the main obstacle would be connecting
the user logic to the second (unknown) hard IP.</p>
<h2>Unlocking the custom part in Quartus</h2>
<p>The database for this custom part is either already integrated into Quartus or
it is delivered to the customer as a separate package (e.g. a DLL or a shared
object).</p>
<p>If one <code>grep</code>s for <code>5SGSMD5</code> in the Quartus directory there is a library that
contains a couple of interesting strings:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ strings libddb_dstr.so | egrep &#39;5SGSMD5&#39;
&lt;...&gt;
5SGSMD5H3F35I3LNAA
&lt;...&gt;
5SGSMD5K3F40I3YY
&lt;...&gt;
5SGSMD5_MS
</code></pre></div>

<p>So far hard work and determination have paid off. It seems that continuing
to poke around Quartus libraries would be the right way ahead.</p>
